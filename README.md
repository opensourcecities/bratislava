# Open Source Bratislava

> A directory of companies, people, and projects that are Open Source and from Bratislava

## Background

Why is there a list combining a licensing model with a geographical location?

Generally, we've found that the Open Source community is just that - a community. People who contribute to open source code often do so because they know other contributors personally, they use each other's code, or they met someone at an event who pointed them to something. You'll find that a lot of open source projects are city specific - frequent attenders of meetups tend to hear about the same projects, learn about the same companies doing open source, and contribute in the same way.

We want to build a list where we can see and learn about each other's code, just a bit easier, in the open.
